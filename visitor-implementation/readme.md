# Median CoBrowse Visitor Implementation

This is the client-side implementation of Median's CoBrowse API.

It consists of a simple dynamic JavaScript application and Median's JavaScript snippet.

Median's Visitor snippet needs to know the sub-account ID and some kind of identifier visitor string that you know on both the visitor and on the server/agent side.
